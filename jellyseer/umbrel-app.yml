  Jellyseerr is a request management and media discovery tool built to work with your existing Plex ecosystem.


  Jellyseerr scans your Plex libraries at regular intervals, so it knows which items are already available on your server.
  It also integrates with the popular DVR applications Radarr and Sonarr, and supports activity monitoring within Jellyseerr itself.


  üõ†Ô∏è SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS

  During initial set-up, you will need to input your Umbrel device's IP address to connect to Plex (and optional services such as Radarr and Sonarr).
  You can find your device's IP address by visiting your router's admin dashboard or by using an IP scanning tool like Angry IP Scanner.
